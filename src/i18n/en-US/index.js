  webgis: "View Dashboard",

  Oceanographic_Variables_desc: `This service issues two monthly bulletins: one for fisheries managers and fishermen, highlighting local oceanographic processes' impact on fish distribution. The second bulletin explores local oceanographic conditions and their effects on fishing operations and coastal communities.`,
  pfz_desc: `Sea surface temperature and ocean colour products are useful for monitoring conditions that affect fish distribution. Ocean colour products including Chl-a data provides measurements of phytoplankton abundance. SST measurements are useful for identifying oceanographic features including upwelling and fronts. These features are associated with nutrient enrichment and areas of the ocean where fish aggregate to feed which can be analyzed to generate potential fishing zones.`,
  ocean_condition_desc: `Access to oceanic data on waves, currents, winds, and sea surface heights is vital for safe navigation, especially in ocean transportation, the primary mode of goods and services transport. "ROUGH," or "DANGEROUS," are disseminated through SMS texts by fisheries institutions. At local fishing communities we use color-coded flags—green for 'CALM,' yellow for 'ROUGH,' and red for 'DANGEROUS'—to share this data, making it easily accessible.`,
  Coastal_Ecosystem_desc: `Assessing, monitoring, and mapping the coastal zone is crucial to safeguarding it from degradation caused by natural processes and human activities. The Coastal Zone Mapping service aims to create accurate maps of coastal resources, enabling the management of natural and human-induced impacts on coastal habitats, such as storm surges affecting flora and fauna distribution and mangrove ecosystems. These maps will also provide data on land-use and land-cover changes, helping coastal zone managers and planners understand the drivers and effects of these changes. `,
  cva_desc: `The goal of Coastal Vulnerability service is to set up an efficient way of monitoring the coastal environment to address the issues related to coastal erosion in these critical areas. The morphological study of the beaches, with their characteristics and changes will provide relevant information for an efficient monitoring of the coastal areas and implement of sound beach-lagoon management practices. Inputs data will include raster and shapefiles of geomorphological, relief and natural habitats indicators. Winds, wave exposure and net sea level change products from models covering the West African region will be an essential input that will help estimate the effect of ocean and winds to the different types of coastal habitats.`,

  about_text: `The MarCNoWA consortium is lead by the Regional Marine Centre of the
        University of Ghana. The objective of the Action is to provide
        decision-makers with EO information and tools that would support
        effective marine and coastal resources management in North and West
        Africa. This is being achieved through delivering EO services that will
        enhance the formulation of marine, fisheries and environmental policies
        to support decision-making at the national and regional level.`,
